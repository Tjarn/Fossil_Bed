# Fossil_Bed
This is my first attempt to use GitHub. 

I'm joining GitHub and opening this repository as an assignment from the Odin Project.

I've made the commitment to work through the foundation parts as a quick scan shows how years of playing has left a lot of my conceptual framework as a logical mess.
This repository will contain my first fumbles and I'll try to keep a journal of my journey here too. Oh, if for some strange reason you might wonder whether you could use anything I author, if it's here, I'll probably say 'yes' but would appreciate it if you would ask first.

OK, I've signed up for an account, created a repository -- a Fossil Bed for an old fossil to rest in.  Now to get out of here and see if I can get back.
