Opened GitHub account with user name of Tjarn.  Created initial README file, then decided that my journal files should start at the beginning
with 001 as the first.  I'm a sporadic writer so I may go a while before the next one, or I may write multiple entries per day.

My intentions are to document my learning for my own benifit.  It's been years (a lot of them) since I worked on any sort of team, so for someone who may have stumbled onto this journal I'll try to explain myself.

I had my 80th birthday on October 28, 2022. My working life started while I was still in Grade School (6th grade) when I took a job as a paper boy.  I bought two papers for a nickle (5 cents or $0.05) and sold them on the street in Dillon, Montana.  By the street I mean the block square of 'Downtown' that included around 10 bars, 4 brothels and the alleys where some of the cowboys and sheepherders ended up at the end of their binge. There were several of us who would haunt the bars and alleys looking for the guy who would buy our papers out.  Rare, but that was a red letter day.

Later jobs included pinsetting at the bowling alley, planting potatoes for the seed potato farm, bucking bales (retrieving bales of hay from the field and stacking it in huge piles.  Good pay for that was $0.05 per bale when stacked.

At this point, there was a bad fire year.  Someone at the BLM asked if I wanted to fight fire.  Young and foolish I said yes. The fire experience led to summer work for the U.S. Forest Service, and three years at the Bender Point Lookout, in what's now the Pintlar Wilderness.  The Old lookout was torn down and rebuilt over a summer.  After helping to build the new lookout, I spent another summer up there. Years later this experience gave me several summers
working for the Wilamette National Forest playing bagpipes and watching for fire from the Iron Mountain lookout.  Before you ask, no, I didn't get lonely.

Iron Mountain got a lot of visitors.  More that I really wanted, as a matter of fact.  But isolation is theraputic for me.

Unfortunately Bender Point lookout wasn't compatible with the designation of Pintar as a wilderness area.  I still look back on a 20 mile horseback trip with 4 pack mules as the beginning of one of the best times of my life.

Enough looking back.  I've played with computers ever since the development of the 4004 microprocesser, learned some assembly language, basic, C, Lisp, prolog, and Smalltalk.  I've worked as an electroncs tech in manufacturing, as a Technical Writer, Writing Manager, and Software engineer. Now it's time to look forward and learn to use some of the tools that I never got around to.

Worked through the Odin Project and got the Odin repo synched up with GitHub.
Then staggered around and synched this up so I can work on this and push to
both repositories.  I've done the other and this is my proof on that.

OK, that works.  I think I'll use this repo to round up all the little python
snippets that I have laying around.  I'll document them so they are more useable.
